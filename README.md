Assignment 1. Dimension Reduction and Clustering Algorithms

1. Choose one dimension reduction or clustering algorithm to implement using c/c++, python, matlab

2. All core algorithms should be written by yourself, except the basic matrix operations, such as SVD decomposition

3. When submit the assignment, the readme.txt should write what dataset has been used and how to run your codes

4. Here are some recommaned datasets. http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/isomap/datasets.html and https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B_P65v9k7Nmed2JPVWNlV3hYYVE
